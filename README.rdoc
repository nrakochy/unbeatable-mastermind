This is a Mastermind game designed to be played in Terminal. The human player chooses a secret code, and the computer will crack the code in 7 guesses or less. To play, 'ruby mastermind.rb' once you get all the files.

In terms of Rspec, I was specifically looking to test the algorithms to make sure that 1) the key pegs were returning the proper values, and 2) the total number of possible answers was being correctly reduced based on the returned key peg value. key_pegs.rb and eliminator.rb are combined and used as reducer.rb with no explicit class in the game. The specs will give you a sense of the logic, though they are not testing the actual game. Probably something that I need to do in the future.

I found an important reduction mechanism in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1185634/how-to-solve-the-mastermind-guessing-game, specifically as it relates to symmetric scoring. This was a helpful insight.
